# TalRashas-PD2-Item-Filter
TalRasha's PD2 Item Filter version 1.7.0 updated December 13, 2020
-removed map ping on magic rings and large charms
-commented out non-eth polearm bases
-removed non +3 mat/gmbow and energy shield bases
-changed dot color to match items (blue for magic, yellow for rare)

I used portions of Filtergale and Wolfiee and others to create a high visibility filter for easy yoinks.

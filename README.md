TalRasha's PD2 Item Filter version 1.7.0 updated December 13, 2020 <br>
-removed map ping on magic rings and large charms <br>
-commented out non-eth polearm bases <br>
-removed non +3 mat/gmbow and energy shield bases <br>
-changed dot color to match items (blue for magic, yellow for rare) <br>
-filter on magic amulets and rings only appears for UnID <br>

I used portions of Filtergale and Wolfiee and others to create a high visibility filter for easy yoinks. <br>

# TalRashas-PD2-Item-Filter <br>
TalRasha's PD2 Item Filter version 2.0 updated March 13, 2021 <br>

Updated to include new maps and map upgrade items.

There are four versions: clean, strict, super strict, and my personal settings. The clean version will show most things. The strict version hides more things but keeps good magic and rare items. The super strict version shows all uniques, hides norm and exceptional set items, doesn't show gems, and only shows magic small and grand charms and only shows rare circlets, amulets, and rings. Use at your own risk.

Copy and paste the code into your existing default.filter file in your PD2 folder

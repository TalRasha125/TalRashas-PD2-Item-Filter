# TalRashas-PD2-Item-Filter <br>
TalRasha's PD2 Item Filter version 2.0 updated March 19, 2021 <br>

Added crafting info

Added ED weapon filter

Updated to include new maps and map upgrade items.

There are three versions: default, strict, super strict. The default version will show most things. The strict version hides more things but keeps good magic and rare items. The super strict version shows all uniques, hides norm and exceptional set items, doesn't show gems, and only shows magic small and grand charms and only shows rare circlets, amulets, and rings. Use at your own risk.

Select filter choice from "Item Profiles" on launcher or copy and paste the code into your existing default.filter file in your local filter PD2 folder
